# 🩺VITALiT
🩺 A Digital Twin framework using Raspberry Pi &amp; biomedical sensors for real-time health monitoring. Features cloud sync, AI-based anomaly detection, dashboards, and caregiver alerts. Scalable for home care, ICUs, and rural healthcare.

📂 The repository contains a Digital Twin framework for real-time physiological monitoring using Raspberry Pi and biomedical sensors. Includes sensor integration, cloud sync (MQTT/REST), AI models (LSTM), dashboards, and alert mechanisms for healthcare applications.

#🏗️ Architecture

The repository contains the following core components of the Digital Twin framework for healthcare monitoring:

Sensors – Collect physiological signals such as heart rate, SpO₂, ECG, respiration, and temperature.

Raspberry Pi – Interfaces with sensors, preprocesses data, and ensures secure transfer using MQTT/REST.

Cloud Digital Twin Model – A virtual patient model hosted on AWS, Azure, or Eclipse Ditto that mirrors real-time health data.

AI Engine – LSTM-based predictive analytics to detect anomalies like arrhythmia, hypoxia, or abnormal breathing.

Dashboard – Real-time visualization of patient vitals using Node-RED or Grafana.

Feedback & Alerts – Sends notifications to caregivers and optionally connects to actuators such as oxygen concentrators or medicine dispensers.
